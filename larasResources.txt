run kinematics.forward_position_kinematics()

the pos and orientation variables come from forward kinematics since sawyer and pykdl are not using the same coordinate system

Camera stuff
#initialize camera
>>> cameras = intera_interface.Cameras()

#turn cameras on
>>> cameras.cameras_io['head_camera']['interface'].set_signal_value('camera_streaming',True)
>>> cameras.cameras_io['right_hand_camera']['interface'].set_signal_value('camera_streaming',True)

#view from head camera perspective

#view from wrist camera
rosrun image_vw image_view image:=/io/internal_camera/right_hand_camera/image_rect
